  <h1>Who am I</h1>
  <p>Howdy there, I'm Elliott, a \$\{age\} year-old Software Engineer originally
    from South Texas but now
  </p>
  <p>
    🌞🌉
    <a href="http://colors.findthedata.com/l/923/International-Orange-Golden-Gate-Bridge">San Francisco</a>
    🌉🌞
  </p>
  <p>Also, the "Comic Sans" is actually my handwriting.</p>

  <h2>What do I do?</h2>
  <p>
    I like and retweet cute dogs on <a href="https://twitter.com/Elliott_Marquez">Twitter</a>.
    🐶
  </p>
  <p>
    I also do a lot of front-end software development for <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>'s
    <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer Project</a> and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome's</a> Web Platform
    team because I work there <span class="elliscript">:)</span>
  </p>

  <h2>What did I do?</h2>
  <p>
    I interned at <a href="https://bing.com">Microsoft</a> and Google, and I did
    research for the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media lab</a> and
    the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also used to do a bunch of book-and-tears-learning in college at
    <a href="https://mit.edu">MIT</a> and ended up getting a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Elliott_Marquez/status/738778510341345283">Bachelors in CS</a>!
    I also learned other things there like, how to stumble in German, physics,
    how to burn chicken, Mesoamerican history, and other random useless stuff;
    like my concentration was in Ancient and Medieval history 🤷‍♂️
  </p>

  <h2>What about before that?</h2>
  <p>
    Before that I went to high school and learned that I really did not want to be a doctor but
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/722/">a math person that pushes buttons</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>What do I like?</h2>
  <p>
    I like dogs, computers, video games, languages, Netflix, puppies, musicals,
    RuPaul's Drag Race, and men. This is not all inclusive; please stalk me on
    social media for more.
