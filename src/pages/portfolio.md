# What stuff do I do?

Currently I'm a part of Google's [Lit Team](https://lit.dev) &
[Material Design](https://material.io) Web team. I do everything from
creating and maintaining our open sourced
[Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-web)
to running the Twitter account! üê¶

## Material Web Components

I helped start and for a while managed the
[Material Design Web Components library](https://github.com/material-components/material-web)
which is the canonical implementation of Material Design on the web that uses
Lit Web Components.

## YouTube

For a long time I helped convert YouTube from their legacy framework to
Web Components and have worked extensively in helping them migrate to
newer and greater things. Also I fix various component-level bugs across
their frontend properties.

## Polymon

For Google I/O '17 I worked with others making everyone's favorite
[physical web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) creature-battling
game Polymon! It was a social game where we hid physical web beacons
around the I/O grounds that each contained a Polymon. Once you collected
several polymon, you could fight each other in a turn-based MTG-like /
Pokemon-like battle.

The game was a PWA, used QR codes to communicate between players,
natively supported deep-linking and sharing via android-beam.

## Microsoft - Bing

I did an internship at Microsoft. I worked on Cortana and Bing
integration designing and implementing some Cortana features.

## Talks and Videos

I have given talks at various Web Component events, summits, and
hackathons. Also have done

## World Wide Web Consortium - Crosscloud

As an undergraduate I did some research at the W3C. While there I worked
on crosscloud which at the time was an experimental foray at
decentralized social profiles.

There I built many types of web applications such as a decentralized
photo gallery and a decentralized twitter (very similar to mastodon
today).

## MIT Media Lab

At the [MIT Media lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), I worked in the
[Responsive Environments Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/responsive-environments/overview/)
A group dedicated to creating context-aware environments that serve
humans.

While there, I worked under a PhD student whose
[research](https://resenv.media.mit.edu/pubs/theses/aldrich-phd.2014.pdf)
was on experimental, perception-based, lighting controls.

There I created a Unity simulation of the lighting controls, helped
present it to investors at an investor symposium, helped acquire
millions of dollars in funding and equipment from Philips, created an
iPhone interface connected to a server that computed the correct
lighting configuration from the student's research and displayed it in
real life. I then created robust data collection program that could play
and replay the touches of test subjects from HCI trials.
