# Who am I

Howdy there, I'm Elliott, a ${'{age}'} year-old Software Engineer
originally from South Texas but now

🌞🌉 San Francisco 🌉🌞

Also, the "Comic Sans" is my handwriting.

## What do I do?
I like and retweet cute dogs on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/techytacos).🐶

I also do a lot of front-end software development for Google's
[Lit team](https://lit.dev), [Material Design](https://material.io) web
team because I work there.

## What did I do?

I used to work at Google Chrome under the Developer Experience and Web
Platform teams.

I interned at Microsoft, Google, and I did research for the
[MIT Media lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) and the W3C.

I also used to do a bunch of book-and-tears-learning in college at
[MIT](https://web.mit.edu) and ended up getting a Bachelors in CS.
