# Who am I

Howdy there, I'm Elliott, a ${'{age}'} year-old Software Engineer
originally from South Texas but now

🌞🌉 San Francisco 🌉🌞

Also, the "Comic Sans" is actually my handwriting.

## What do I do?
I like and retweet cute dogs on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/techytacos).🐶

I also do a lot of front-end software development for Google's
[Lit team](https://lit.dev), [Material Design](https://material.io) web
team because I work there.

## What did I do?

I used to work at Google Chrome under the Developer Experience and Web
Platform teams.

I interned at icrosoft, Google, and I did research for the
[MIT Media lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) and the W3C.

I also used to do a bunch of book-and-tears-learning in college at
[MIT](https://web.mit.edu) and ended up getting a Bachelors in CS. I
also learned other things there like, how to stumble in German, physics,
how to burn chicken, Mesoamerican history, and other random useless
stuff (my concentration was in Ancient and Medieval history 🤷‍♂️).

## What about before that?

Before that I went to high school and learned that I really did not want
to be a doctor but rather a math person that pushes buttons.

## What do I like?

I like dogs, computers, video games, languages, Netflix, puppies,
musicals, and men. This is not all inclusive; please look at my social
media for more.
